# WSM Documentation Index

## Default Active Context

Read only these files for ordinary task startup:

1. ../AGENTS.md
2. PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md
3. PROGRESS_EN.md
4. NEXT_TASK_EN.md

Then read only the active-stage detail file and source/config files explicitly named by NEXT_TASK_EN.md.

The default context intentionally does **not** include the full historical ledger or closed-stage plans.

## Planning

- [PROGRESS_EN.md](PROGRESS_EN.md) — authoritative current state plus high-level project roadmap.
- [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) — optional cross-stage detailed formulation, architecture, experiment matrix, promotion rules, risks, and orchestration.
- [plan/README.md](plan/README.md) — stage-plan index.
- [plan/STAGE_6.md](plan/STAGE_6.md) — current active Stage-6 detailed plan.

Closed-stage plan files are optional. Do not load them unless the task requires historical plan detail.

## Historical Progress

- [archive/PROGRESS_EN_THROUGH_STAGE5_2026-09-28.md](archive/PROGRESS_EN_THROUGH_STAGE5_2026-09-28.md) — full historical English progress ledger through Stage-5 closure.

This archive is preserved for auditability and exact old evidence. It is **not** required reading for ordinary tasks.

## Research References

Load only when relevant:

- BASELINES.md;
- SOTA_REVIEW_EN.md;
- PROJECT_INIT_STRUCTURE.md.

SOTA_REVIEW_EN.md is a compact English synthesis intended to reduce agent context while preserving the methods, gaps, equations, and bibliography relevant to the plan.

## Archival Russian Originals

The following files are retained only to avoid destructive information loss:

- SOTA_REVIEW.md;
- PROGRESS.md;
- NEXT_TASK.md;
- ../first_question.md;
- ../scripts/ag_with_code.txt.

Agents MUST use the English active versions instead:

- SOTA_REVIEW_EN.md;
- PROGRESS_EN.md;
- NEXT_TASK_EN.md;
- ../first_question_EN.md;
- ../scripts/ag_with_code_EN.txt.

Do not load both language variants into the same context.
